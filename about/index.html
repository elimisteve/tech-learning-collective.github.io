<p>The Tech Learning Collective offers low-cost courses on computer technologies specifically for Left-leaning politically engaged individuals and groups. Courses cater to people with skill levels ranging from self-identified “beginners” to very experienced technologists.</p>

<p>The first version of the TLC was formed in 2016 by a group of radicals who sought out methods of mutual self-education around technology, and met regularly in Brooklyn. None of us were formally trained technologists; none of us have ever held computer science degrees. Many of the traditional techniques of and environments offering technology education felt alienating to us.</p>

<p>From 2016 to 2019, TLC members dispersed into a number of community projects, but the need to offer high quality technology education to groups and individuals engaged in radical, grassroots, and non-profit community projects remained. Today, the TLC serves both to offer exceptional Information Technology (IT) educational opportunities at a much lower cost than traditional computer courses, and as a means to provide supplementary funding for the existent activist projects that grew out of the first version of the TLC in the mid 2010&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>In keeping with our original mission, the TLC is especially in service to people who might identify themselves as being “outsiders” to the mainstream “tech world.” That is, those folks who have either never been tech workers or who have otherwise felt at odds with the general culture of technocapitalism, its tech bros, and its monocultural intentions.</p>

<p>The goal of the TLC is to provide its students with the resources and abilities to in turn provide for their communities, especially as it relates to liberating their communities from corporate overseers (like Google and Facebook). Our students already assist in the organization of projects like community gardens, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copwatch">Copwatch</a> programs, and other projects that help build collective power. At TLC, students learn how to extend the existing capabilities of their projects and communities using free, open, and ubiquitous digital technologies.</p>

<h3 id="statement-of-intent">Statement of Intent</h3>

<p>The TLC has two primary goals.</p>

<h4 id="radical-technology-education">Radical technology education</h4>

<p>Firstly, it is the intention of the TLC to offer educational resources to groups and individuals engaged in projects that lie outside the realm of technocapitalism. In other words, our teachers train technologists or would-be technologists who are not primarily interested in working at a faceless tech corporation or becoming an entrepreneur, but who are rather working within community-based, grassroots, and activist spheres.</p>

<p>We do this by offering a range of <a href="{{ "/courses/" | relative_url }}">courses</a> on a sliding scale basis.</p>

<h4 id="fund-existing-technology-centered-community-projects">Fund existing technology-centered community projects</h4>

<p>Tuition for TLC courses should be understood as a way to provide supplementary funding to existing technology-centered community projects, in order that these projects may more easily:

<ul>
    <li>
        continue offering other programming for free;
    </li>
    <li>
        fund new additional community infrastructure projects which are always offered for free.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="enrollment-application-process">Enrollment application process</h3>

<p>TLC courses have a two-stage enrollment process.</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>First, you must first submit an application along with a $25 application fee. (See <a href="#pricing">§ Pricing</a> for details.) The application consists of a short questionaire intended to help TLC admissions ensure you and your peers will get the most out of your course experience. If the course you are signing up for requires a prerequisite that you have not completed, you will be required to pass a quiz to ensure you are ready for the course. (If you don’t pass, you will have the option of defering your application or applying your application fee to one of the prerequisite courses instead of the course to which you initially applied.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>If your application is approved, you will be contacted to schedule a remote video interview. The interview is a casual, short (~20 minute) conversation conducted by a TLC trainer or teaching assistant.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>If you are accepted as a student, you will be eligible to enroll in the next available course to which you have applied. You do not necessarily have to enroll in the next course, although if there are not enough students for a given course, the course will be postponed.</p>
<p>If you are not accepted as a student, please don’t take it personally. This simply means that, at the moment, we think you’ll be a better fit for a class elsewhere. However, you are welcome to re-apply as early as two months later. While your original application fee is non-refundable, re-applying for the same course will waive your application fee. (This waiver does not apply to applications for different courses.)</p>

<h3 id="pricing">Pricing</h3>

<p>All courses are offered on a sliding scale basis. Most courses range from $25.00 USD – $100.00 USD per course. Your cost for a course will be evaluated during your application process and is based solely on your financial means. The outstanding balance for a course, along with payment information, will be sent to you before the course’s orientation session.</p>

<p>TLC charges a non-refundable application fee of $25.00 per course. This fee rolls into tuition. For example, if your sliding scale cost is evaluated to be $25.00, once you have paid your application fee your outstanding balance for the course will be $0. If your sliding scale cost is evaluated to be $50.00, you will be charged $25.00 prior to the start of the course.</p>

<p>Please note there are <em>no</em> refunds.</p>
