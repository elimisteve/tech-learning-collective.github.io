The TLC has two primary goals.

<h3 id="radical-technology-education">Radical technology education</h3>

Firstly, it is the intention of the TLC to offer educational resources to groups and individuals engaged in projects that lie outside the realm of technocapitalism. In other words, our teachers train technologists or would-be technologists who are not primarily interested in working at a faceless tech corporation or becoming an entrepreneur, but who are rather working within community-based, grassroots, and activist spheres.

We do this by offering a range of [courses]({{ "/courses/" | relative_url }}) on a sliding scale basis.

<h3 id="fund-existing-technology-centered-community-projects">Fund existing technology-centered community projects</h3>

Tuition for TLC courses should be understood as a way to provide supplementary funding to existing technology-centered community projects, in order that these projects may more easily:

* continue offering other programming for free;
* fund new additional community infrastructure projects which are always offered for free.

<h3 id="our-history">Our History</h3>

The Tech Learning Collective offers low-cost courses on computer technologies specifically for Left-leaning politically engaged individuals and groups. Courses cater to people with skill levels ranging from self-identified “beginners” to very experienced technologists.

The first version of the TLC was formed in 2016 by a group of radicals who sought out methods of mutual self-education around technology, and met regularly in Brooklyn. None of us were formally trained technologists; none of us have ever held computer science degrees. Many of the traditional techniques of and environments offering technology education felt alienating to us.

From 2016 to 2019, TLC members dispersed into a number of community projects, but the need to offer high quality technology education to groups and individuals engaged in radical, grassroots, and non-profit community projects remained. Today, the TLC serves both to offer exceptional Information Technology (IT) educational opportunities at a much lower cost than traditional computer courses, and as a means to provide supplementary funding for the existent activist projects that grew out of the first version of the TLC in the mid 2010&rsquo;s.

<p>In keeping with our original mission, the TLC is especially in service to people who might identify themselves as being “outsiders” to the mainstream “tech world.” That is, those folks who have either never been tech workers or who have otherwise felt at odds with the general culture of technocapitalism, its tech bros, and its monocultural intentions.</p>

<p>The goal of the TLC is to provide its students with the resources and abilities to in turn provide for their communities, especially as it relates to liberating their communities from corporate overseers (like Google and Facebook). Our students already assist in the organization of projects like community gardens, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copwatch">Copwatch</a> programs, and other projects that help build collective power. At TLC, students learn how to extend the existing capabilities of their projects and communities using free, open, and ubiquitous digital technologies.</p>
