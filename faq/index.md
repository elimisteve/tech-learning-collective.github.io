## What do I need to bring to class?

As every Tech Learning Collective course focuses on hands-on, experience-based training, you will need a portable personal computer running any modern version of [Apple&rsquo;s macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/what-is/), [Microsoft Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/windows), or any flavor of the [GNU/Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux) operating systems to take full advantage of class time. For certain courses, [Google Chromebooks](https://www.google.com/chromebook/) and certain handheld or tablet computers may suffice, but are generally not recommended as they can be severely constrained by their manufacturer or vendor. If in doubt, please either [contact]({{ "/contact/" | relative_url }}) us or bring up your concerns during your [enrollment process]({{ "/enrollment/" | relative_url }}).

## What if I don&rsquo;t have a laptop?

If you cannot afford or acquire a computer sufficient for the course you are enrolling in, we may be able to provide a temporary device for you to use during your course. In this case, we will ask for an additional deposit from you and will return your deposit to you after you return the computer to us at the end of your final class. Alternatively, for some courses, you can also purchase a single-board computer (SBC) such as a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) from us at cost and we will provide the necessary peripherals (keyboard, pointing device, video display, and power supply) for use during your class. A Raspberry Pi generally retails for ~$35 USD, is sufficient for almost all TLC courses, and will be yours to keep.

## Can I pay my course tuition in installments?

Generally, no. Our [flexible pricing model and sliding-scale tuition]({{ "/pricing/" | relative_url }}) helps ensure that all Tech Learning Collective courses are affordable. If you need financial assistance, please voice your concerns during your [enrollment process]({{ "/enrollment/" | relative_url }}). More often than not, your tuition can be reduced based on your needs, but we still ask that you pay tuition in full before the start of your course's first class.
