## What do I need to bring to class?

As every Tech Learning Collective course focuses on hands-on, experience-based training, **you will need a portable personal computer** running any modern version of [Apple&rsquo;s macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/what-is/), [Microsoft Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/windows), or any flavor of the [GNU/Linux](https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux) operating systems to take full advantage of class time. For certain courses, [Google Chromebooks](https://www.google.com/chromebook/) and certain handheld or tablet computers may suffice, but are generally not recommended as they can be severely constrained by their manufacturer or vendor. If in doubt, please either [contact]({{ "/contact/" | relative_url }}) us or bring up your concerns during your [enrollment process]({{ "/enrollment/" | relative_url }}).

Learning a lot in a short period of time can also make one very hungry, so we also advise that you arrive to class well-fed or that you bring a meal with you.

## What if I don&rsquo;t have a laptop?

If you cannot afford or acquire a computer sufficient for the course you are enrolling in, we may be able to provide a temporary device for you to use during your course. In this case, we will ask for an additional deposit from you and will return your deposit to you after you return the computer to us at the end of your final class. Alternatively, for some courses, you can also purchase a single-board computer (SBC) such as a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) from us at cost and we will provide the necessary peripherals (keyboard, pointing device, video display, and power supply) for use during your class. A Raspberry Pi generally retails for ~$35 USD, is sufficient for almost all TLC courses, and will be yours to keep.

## Where are classes held?

The Tech Learning Collective partners with several organizations that provide classroom spaces around New York City. We typically determine the classroom location for a specific course one to two months before the course begins. Course locations are determined based on a combination of classroom and teacher availability.

After you [enroll]({{ "/enrollment/" | relative_url }}), you will receive access to our course scheduler and will be able to choose the course timeline that best suits your schedule. The scheduler provides details regarding course logistics, including classroom locations. All classes in a given course are held in the same classroom for the duration of the course unless otherwise noted in the scheduler.

We strive to ensure that students have access to gender-neutral restrooms and that each classroom is wheelchair accessible, but cannot always gaurantee this. Our course scheduler indicates which classrooms provide which amenities so that you can make a more informed choice regarding the specific course timeline and location you ultimately choose to attend.

At this time, all Tech Learning Collective courses are only offered in person. You must physically arrive at class to participate.

## Can I pay my course tuition in installments?

Generally, no. Our [flexible pricing model and sliding-scale tuition]({{ "/pricing/" | relative_url }}) helps ensure that all Tech Learning Collective courses are affordable. If you need financial assistance, please voice your concerns during your [enrollment process]({{ "/enrollment/" | relative_url }}). More often than not, your tuition can be reduced based on your needs, but we still ask that you pay tuition in full before the start of your course's first class.
