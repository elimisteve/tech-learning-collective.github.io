Let *Mr. Robot* teach you how to hack—and how to stop hackers from hacking you! In this course, we will use the television show “Mr. Robot,” a TV show dramatizing the lives of rogue hackers in NYC with unparalleled technical accuracy, as our primary educational material. Learners will get an introduction to how the tools, techniques, and procedures shown in the episode work in real life, and also have the opportunity to learn how to use the tools depicted on their own machines. By the end of the first season, you’ll have gotten a hands-on tour of various tools in the Kali Linux penetration testing distro, and a better sense of how to separate fiction from reality in contemporary hacking dramas in pop culture.

*Please note that this television show contains graphic and potentially triggering content.*
