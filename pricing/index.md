All courses are offered on a sliding scale basis. Most courses range from $25.00 USD – $100.00 USD per course. Most courses consist of four weekly sessions ranging from three to four and a half hours each and are usually held on weekends. Please check the details for the course you&rsquo;re interested in before enrolling, as we do not offer refunds or discounts. The exact price for a course is evaluated during your application process and is based *solely* on your financial means. Your outstanding balance for course enrollment, along with payment information, will be sent to you before the course’s orientation session.

The Tech Learning Collective charges a non-refundable application fee of $25.00 USD per course. This fee rolls into tuition. For example, if your sliding scale cost is evaluated to be $25.00, your outstanding balance for the course will be $0 USD after you have paid your application fee. If your sliding scale cost is evaluated to be $50.00 USD, your outstanding balance will be $25.00 USD.

Please note that we do *not* offer refunds.
