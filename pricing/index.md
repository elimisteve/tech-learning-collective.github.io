Tech Learning Collective offers unparalleled and affordable technology education for both [individuals](#individuals) and [groups](#groups).

### Individuals

All courses are offered on a sliding scale basis. Most courses range from $100.00 to $300.00 (USD) per course. Most courses consist of four weekly sessions ranging from three to four and a half hours each, which breaks down to ~$7 to ~$20 per hour of classtime, and are usually held on weekends or in the late afternoon and early evenings. Please confirm the details for the course you&rsquo;re enrolling in, as we do not offer refunds or discounts beyond sliding scale tuition.

Your exact cost for a course is evaluated during your application process and is based *solely* on your financial means. Your outstanding balance for course enrollment, along with payment information, will be sent to you before the start of your courseâ€™s orientation session.

The Tech Learning Collective charges a non-refundable application fee of ${{ site.payments.prices.application_fee }} USD per course. This fee is the same for all courses and rolls into tuition. For example, if your sliding scale cost is evaluated to be ${{ site.payments.prices.application_fee }}, your outstanding balance for the course will be zero after you have paid your application fee. If your sliding scale cost is evaluated to be $100.00, your outstanding balance will be $75.00.

Please note that we do *not* offer refunds.

### Groups

Organizations can attend Tech Learning Collective courses as part of corporate or group training for a slightly reduced tuition. We typically offer a 10% reduction in tuition with group courses for batches of 15 or more students. Group tuition fees are not eligible for individual sliding scale adjustments.
